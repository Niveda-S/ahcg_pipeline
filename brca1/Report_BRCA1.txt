NO MUTATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED

From the analysis, no pathogenic variants were identified that increased the risk of breast cancer.
This does not completely eliminate the risk of breast cancer, environmental and living conditions also play a role.

Genes analyzed in this analysis includes:
	BRCA1

The following variants were identified:
	#CHR	LOCATION	REF	ALT	DEPTH PATHOGENICITY
	chr17	41196408	G	A	59	Benign(ENIGMA); Benign (ClinVar)
	chr17	41197274	C	A	78	Benign(ENIGMA); Benign (ClinVar)
	chr17	41223094	T	C	103	Benign(ENIGMA); Benign,no_known_pathogenicity (ClinVar); Pending (BIC)
	chr17	41234470	A	G	119	Benign(ENIGMA); Benign (ClinVar); Class 1 (BIC)

Methodology and Limitations:
Mutations associated with the BRCA1 gene are identified in this analysis to test for risk of breast cancer. The DNA samples are sequenced and variants are found using Haplotype Caller.
The pathogenic nature of variants are tested by comparing against an external database- brcaExchange.
It should be noted that so far variants have been tested against only one gene: BRCA1. The study will soon be expanded to include all breast and ovarian cancer related genes. 
Furthermore, the depth of coverage of the variants has also been recorded to ensure that the coverage is not too small and some data is not missed via this analysis. A graph showing the depth of coverage per base of the variant has also been attached.
